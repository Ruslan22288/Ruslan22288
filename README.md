## 🧱 Random Dev Quote (Wall — vertical)
<!-- Vertical-style quote: each word on its own line to make a "wall" effect -->
> ```
> Just

> doesn't
> mean
> you
> understand
> it.

## 🚀 My Biggest Project
**Project name** — short description.  
- Tech: Django / PostgreSQL / Docker  
- Live: `https://your-site.example` (if deployed)  
- Repo: `https://github.com/Ruslan22288/your-project`

## ✨ Nice-to-have README tricks (already added above)
- Horizontal badges for quick visual skills scan (floor)  
- Vertical quote for creative visual separation (wall)  
- GitHub stats + top langs + streaks for activity signals  
- Links to live demos and repos to show work instantly

---

## How to customize
1. Replace `Ruslan22288` in the stats URLs with your GitHub username.  
2. Change or add badges in the **Tech Stack** line to reflect your real skills. Use `https://shields.io` to get new badges.  
3. Swap the quote text if you want another phrase — to keep the "wall" effect, put each word on a new line inside the triple backticks.

Enjoy — paste this into your `README.md` and commit. If you want, I can:
- Translate the vertical quote to Ukrainian while keeping the English copy,
- Replace the vertical quote with an SVG (more polished) — I can provide SVG code you can add,
- Or make a responsive two-column layout (desktop vs mobile friendly).
